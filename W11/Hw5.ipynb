This time series is hourly electricity load of a certain area in India. This is something that should be forecasted since, only in which case you decide how much electricity you need to generate.\n","1.   Inspect the series carefully, see if there are any missing values. If so impute them by a proper method. Do do this use data.interpolate()\n"," [See here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.interpolate.html) for further information.\n","2. Your aim is to predict next hours electricty load.\n","3. You will use classical machine learning methods (see notebook W8P2.ipynb for furthre functions).\n","To do this\n","*   Split the data set into train and test sets (Remember the thing with time series: Thou shall not shuffle!)\n","*   Do 5-fold cross validation ([see here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html) and [here](https://https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)) on the train set to pick up the right parameters. \n","### Remember when doing cross validation set n_jobs = -1 so that you boost your calculations. If possible, do this on your local machine.\n","*   Return your R2 score on the test set ([see here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html)).\n","*   Please do this on at least 3 regressors: Good choices would be at least one of KNN, RF, ANN or maybe Gradient Boosted Trees (Feel free to apply any other methods or tricks in your mind), or you may wish to do some other ensemble learning.\n","\n","You have 10 days to return this HW. \n","Cheers,\n","Y.A."],"metadata":{"id":"LyDGJ3MgDvqV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"oka4kdp_DtpJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
